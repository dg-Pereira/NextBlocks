# NextBlocks #

NextBlocks is a new block programming platform implemented as a Moodle plugin. This 
platform will allow for the creation of custom exercises by educators, and it will 
have a heavy focus on social perception and collaboration features. This platform 
will support features that are uncommon in block programming environments, with the 
added convenience of being implemented in a platform that many students already use 
regularly.

## Installing via uploaded ZIP file ##

1. Log in to your Moodle site as an admin and go to _Site administration >
